# Data Modeling Drafts

we need to create a machine learning model to forecast weekly sales.

1. Divide the data into train and test categories (80% and 20%)
2. Create two different supervised learning models to forecast weekly sales based on specific characteristics.
3. Compare the results of the two models and choose the best one.
4. Create a clustering model to group together store categories with similar sales characteristics. which number of
   clusters is the best? and why?
