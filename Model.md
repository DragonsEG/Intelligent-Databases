## What is a model in ML?
- A model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process.
- It is a program that improves its performance at some task through experience.

## What is Supervised Learning?
- Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.
## What is Unsupervised Learning?
- A type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data ```WITHOUT LABELED RESPONSES```.
## What is Reinforcement Learning?
- An area of machine learning concerned with how software agents should to take actions in an environment in order to ```maximize the notion of cumulative reward.```
## What is Semi-supervised Learning?
- A class of machine learning tasks and techniques that also ```make use of unlabeled data for training.```

# Supervised Learning VS Semi-supervised Learning
![SL vs Semi-SL](https://content.altexsoft.com/media/2022/03/supervised-vs-unsupervised-vs-semi-supervised-mach.png.webp)

- SL aims to learn a function that, given a sample of data and ```desired outputs```, ```approximates``` a function that maps inputs to outputs.
- Semi-SL aims to ```label unlabeled data``` points using knowledge learned ```from a small number of labeled data``` points.
